# LSTM-Natural-Language-Processing

Natural Language Processing using LSTM neural networks for text generation.

I used an LSTM followed by two branch of fully connected neural networks in order to generate new text. The learning is based on Lewis Carroll books "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and "Alice Through the Looking Glass". The two branches of fully connected neural networks concern one the in-speech learning and generation and the other the off-speech learning and generation.

A deep data engineering is implemented when the dataset is imported, with a high use of Python re (regular expression) package.

The library used for the neural network is PyTorch.
